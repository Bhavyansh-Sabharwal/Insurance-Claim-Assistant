## Script

**(0:00-0:15) Introduction**

**(Visual: Show a montage of news footage of natural disasters, damaged homes, and stressed people dealing with paperwork.)**

**Narrator:** "Dealing with the aftermath of a disaster is overwhelming.  The last thing you need is a complicated insurance claim process.  Introducing Recoverly – the app designed to simplify your claim and help you get back on your feet."

**(Visual: Transition to a clean shot of the Recoverly app's dashboard.)**

**Narrator:** "Recoverly helps you document your losses, organize your documents, and collaborate with others, all in one secure place."

We came up with this idea after the California Wildfires, which impacted thousands of people. The last thing people should be worried about in a time like this is getting their insurance claims filed. This is a stressful process, and people often loose thousands of dollars because they aren't able to recall all of their items after a disater. That's where Recoverly comes in.

**Narrator:** "Simply upload a photo of the room..."

**(Visual: Show the object detection in progress. Then show the DetectedObjectsModal with the detected objects.)**

**Narrator:** "...and Recoverly automatically detects and categorizes items for you!  It even estimates their value."

**(Visual: Click "Add to Inventory" for a couple of the detected objects.)**
